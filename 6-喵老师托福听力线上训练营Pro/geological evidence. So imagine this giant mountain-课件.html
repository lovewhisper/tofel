range, eight thousand kilometers long and a thousand kilometers wide, the largest ever near the equator, weathering and eroding. Remember that weathering refers to the breakdown of rock into soil, primarily by physical and chemical forces and occurs most quickly in the tropics where the heavy tropical rainfalls would carry countless tons of the weathered Super Mountain and all that nutrient-rich soil within it downhill into the ocean.</p><p>Male Student: <span style="color:rgb(222,120,2)">So how about those nutrients get into the food chain</span><span style="color:rgb(222,120,2)"> and</span><span style="color:rgb(222,120,2)"> and affect species diversification</span><span style="color:rgb(216,57,49)"><strong>?</strong></span></p><p>Professor: <span style="color:rgb(222,120,2)">That would have first been absorbed by simple marine plants like algae,</span> <span style="color:rgb(222,120,2)">then by the microorganisms that ate the algae, and then</span><span style="color:rgb(222,120,2)">by the larger organisms that ate the microorganisms and on up the line. ⑤</span>At each level, populations were quickly expanded, diversified and in just five to ten million years, evolved into increasingly complex species.
