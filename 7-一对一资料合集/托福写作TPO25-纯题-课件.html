<h1>综合写作</h1><h2>Reading Material</h2><span style="font-family: -apple-system, &quot;San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;PingFang SC&quot;, &quot;Hiragino Sans GB&quot;, STHeiti, &quot;Microsoft Yahei&quot;, &quot;Microsoft JhengHei&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans SC&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans CJK SC&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans CN&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans SC&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans TC&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans CJK TC&quot;, &quot;WenQuanYi Micro Hei&quot;, 驿微米黑, SimSun, sans-serif; text-align: justify;">In 1938 an archaeologist in Iraq acquired a set of clay jars that had been excavated two years earlier by villagers constructing a railroad line. The vessels were about 2,200 years old. Each clay jar contained a copper cylinder surrounding an iron rod. The archaeologist proposed that the vessels were ancient electric batteries and even demonstrated that they can produce a small electric current when filled with some liquids. However, it is not likely that the vessels were actually used as electric batteries in ancient times.</span><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.75em;"><br/><span style="font-family: -apple-system, &quot;San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;PingFang SC&quot;, &quot;Hiragino Sans GB&quot;, STHeiti, &quot;Microsoft Yahei&quot;, &quot;Microsoft JhengHei&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans SC&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans CJK SC&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans CN&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans SC&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans TC&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans CJK TC&quot;, &quot;WenQuanYi Micro Hei&quot;, 驿微米黑, SimSun, sans-serif;">First of all, if the vessels were used as batteries, they would probably have been attached to some electricity conductors such as metal wires. But there is no evidence that any metal wires were located near the vessels. All that has been excavated are the vessels themselves.</span><br/><br/><span style="font-family: -apple-system, &quot;San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;PingFang SC&quot;, &quot;Hiragino Sans GB&quot;, STHeiti, &quot;Microsoft Yahei&quot;, &quot;Microsoft JhengHei&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans SC&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans CJK SC&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans CN&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans SC&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans TC&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans CJK TC&quot;, &quot;WenQuanYi Micro Hei&quot;, 驿微米黑, SimSun, sans-serif;">Second, the copper cylinders inside the jars look exactly like copper cylinders discovered in the ruins of Seleucia, an ancient city located nearby. We know that the copper cylinders from Seleucia were used for holding scrolls of sacred texts, not for generating electricity. Since the cylinders found with the jars have the same shape, it is very likely they were used for holding scrolls as well. That no scrolls were found inside the jars can be explained by the fact that the scrolls simply disintegrated over the centuries.</span><br/><br/><span style="font-family: -apple-system, &quot;San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;PingFang SC&quot;, &quot;Hiragino Sans GB&quot;, STHeiti, &quot;Microsoft Yahei&quot;, &quot;Microsoft JhengHei&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans SC&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans CJK SC&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans CN&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans SC&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans TC&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans CJK TC&quot;, &quot;WenQuanYi Micro Hei&quot;, 驿微米黑, SimSun, sans-serif;">Finally, what could ancient people have done with the electricity that the vessels were supposed to have generated? They had no devices that relied on electricity. As batteries, the vessels would have been completely useless to them.</span></p><h2>Lecture</h2><p><iframe src="https://iframe.xiaoeknow.com/page/?id=AED704CC-87BE-11DE-5F90-26335FEFD8C8&type=2" class="xiaoe-iframe-audio" height="72px" width="100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p><h1>独立写作</h1><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 13px; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; white-space: normal; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.75em;"><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5;">Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?</span></p><p class="p2" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; min-height: 16px; white-space: normal;"><br/></p><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 13px; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; white-space: normal; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.75em;"><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communities.</strong></span></p>
