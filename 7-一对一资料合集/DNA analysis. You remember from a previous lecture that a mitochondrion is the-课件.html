energy producing structure in cells, right? <span style="color:rgb(222,120,2)">Well, it has a much more stable structure than a nucleus.

And what does all this mean? Well, because the fossil is so old, polar bears must have survived Earth&#39;s last interglacial warming period, about 45,000 years ago. But polar
