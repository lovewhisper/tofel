According to paragraph 2, which of the following statements about soil creation is true?</span></p><p style="white-space: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">A. Soil creation requires that there be more plants than animals in any given location.</span></p><p style="white-space: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">B. Soil is created from the organic debris left over when bacteria decompose.</span></p><p style="white-space: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">C. Soil creation occurs when a cubic centimeter of existing soil contains abundant organic material.</span></p><p style="white-space: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">D. Soil is created as a result of bacteria breaking down rocks and organic material.</span></p><p style="white-space: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p><p style="white-space: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">5. In paragraph 2, why does the author mention the activity of fungi in acidic soils?</span></p><p style="white-space: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">A. To demonstrate that fungi are capable of nitrogen fixation under certain conditions.</span></p><p style="white-space: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">B. To support the claim that microscopic plants besides bacteria contribute to soil development.</span></p><p style="white-space: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">C. To show that fungi play a different role from bacteria in decomposing organic matter.</span></p><p style="white-space: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">D. To account for the survival rate of microscopic plants in highly acidic soils.</span></p><p style="white-space: normal; text-align: justify;"><br/><br/><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">More complex forms of vegetation play several vital roles with respect to the soil.&nbsp;Tress, grass, and other large plants supply the <strong>bulk </strong>of the soil&#39;s humus.&nbsp;The minerals released as these plants decompose on the surface constitute an important nutrient source for succeeding generations of plants as well as for other soil organisms.&nbsp;In addition, trees can extend their roots deep within the soil and bring up nutrients from far below the surface.&nbsp;These nutrients eventually enrich the surface soil when the tree drops its leaves or when it dies and decomposes.&nbsp;Finally, trees perform the vital function of slowing water runoff and holding the soil in place with their root systems, thus combating erosion.&nbsp;The increased erosion that often accompanies agricultural use of sloping land is principally caused by the removal of its protective cover of natural vegetation.</span></p><p style="white-space: normal;"><br/></p><p style="white-space: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Paragraph 3</span></p><p style="white-space: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">6.

According to paragraph 3, how do trees benefit other plants?</span></p><p style="white-space: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">A. Trees make deep-lying nutrients available to plants whose roots do not extend very far into the soil.</span></p><p style="white-space: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">B. When trees decompose, they release nutrients minerals deep into the soil.</span></p><p style="white-space: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">C. Humus from trees provides nutrients for plants with roots that extend deep within the soil.</span></p><p style="white-space: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">D. When trees die and decompose, they make available a large space for generations of other plants to grow.</span></p><p style="white-space: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p><p style="white-space: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">8. Paragraph 3 supports which of the following inferences about the effect of vegetation on soil?</span></p><p style="white-space: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">A. The root systems of most crops are unable to prevent erosion on sloping ground.</span></p><p style="white-space: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">B. Without a cover of vegetation, fast running water is likely to disappear from the ground surface before it can erode much of the soil.</span></p><p style="white-space: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">C. The roots of trees and other large plants remove much water from the ground, making the soil dry and likely to be eroded by the wind.</span></p><p style="white-space: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">D. Areas that naturally have little vegetation, such as deserts, are more easily eroded than is agricultural land that has been cleared of its natural vegetation.</span></p><p style="white-space: normal;"><br/></p><p style="white-space: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">9.

According to paragraph 5, in which of the following ways do some mammals help soils develop?</span></p><p style="white-space: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">A. They prevent insects from feeding on nutrients that enrich the soil.</span></p><p style="white-space: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">B.

They were all based on Forbes&#39;s observations.</span></p><p style="white-space: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">B.

According to paragraph 4, what was one mistake that Forbes made?</span></p><p style="white-space: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">A. He assumed that Aegean&#39;s depths and other oceans&#39; depths had comparable animal diversity.</span></p><p style="white-space: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">B. He placed too much importance on the fact the Aegean had been the birthplace of marine biology.</span></p><p style="white-space: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">C. He failed to notice that his samples of marine life mostly came from the sea bottom and were not typical of life-forms at higher levels.</span></p><p style="white-space: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">D. He did not realize that the seafloor in many parts of Earth is much deeper than it is in Aegean.</span></p><p style="white-space: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p><p style="white-space: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">10. According to paragraph 4, Forbes&#39;s dredge had each of the following problems EXCEPT:</span></p><p style="white-space: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">A. It opening was too small to collect certain kinds of animals.</span></p><p style="white-space: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">B. The holes in its net were so large that animals could escape through them.</span></p><p style="white-space: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">C. It could not get all the way down to the Aegean seafloor to sample the animals there.</span></p><p style="white-space: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">D. Many animals were lost out of its open mouth when it was pulled up.</span></p><p style="white-space: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p><p style="white-space: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">11.

Edward Forbes developed the view, based on research in the Aegean, that both the number and variety of life-forms decline with ocean depth and disappear entirely below 1,800 feet.</span></p><p style="white-space: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">B. Before Forbes conducted his research in the Aegean, most naturalists believed that the deep sea was filled with a pool of cold, dense water that had gradually sunk to the depths from above.</span></p><p style="white-space: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">C. The existence of an azoic zone in the Atlantic Ocean had earlier been established by Sir John Ross, who used a scoop to sample sediment located thousands of feet deep in Baffin Bay.</span></p><p style="white-space: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">D. Forbes carried out his research using a small dredge that invented during the time that he spent working on the HMS Beacon, conducting a survey of the Aegean for the English Royal Navy.</span></p><p style="white-space: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">E. Frobes&#39;s data was misleading because it was limited to the Aegean, where animal diversity at depths is unusually low, and because his collecting tool was unable to capture much animal life that did exist.</span></p><p style="white-space: normal; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">F.

Birds are more likely to determine the survival rates of moths in rural rather than industrial areas.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">C. Environment determines whether dark or light forms of the moth survive.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">D. The presence of lichen on tree trunks encourages birds to prey on both dark and light forms of the moth with the same frequency.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">8.

What is the purpose of paragraph 5 in the passage?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">A. To explain why Kettlewell&#39;s view has been widely misunderstood.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">B. To present a view that various researchers have criticized.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">C. To suggest why new developments seem to confirm Kettlewell&#39;s view.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">D. To state one of the proposed alternatives to Kettlewell&#39;s view.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">11. According to paragraph 5, which of the following is true of melanic forms in Liverpool?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">A. Increased sulphur dioxide pollution decreased their numbers after 1975.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">B. Their population slowly increased from 1975 to 1989.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">C. From 1950 on, they have seldom been seen in the Liverpool area.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">D. Before 1975 their population was higher than that of light-colored moths.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">12. In paragraph 5 the change in the frequency of melanic forms is attributed to which of the following?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">A. New kinds of pollution in Liverpool</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">B. The passage of the Clean Air Act in 1965</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">C. Changes in rates of genetic mutation</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">D.

Over time, peppered moth populations in Germany and England migrated from nonindustrialized areas to those that were industrialized.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">B. Kettlewell&#39;s experiments showed that birds were acting as a selecting force by eating light-colored moths on dark trees in polluted areas.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">C. According to Kettlewell&#39;s theory, natural selection produced birds that were better able to detect moths even when areas were polluted.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">D. Originally most peppered moths were pale in color, but especially in areas of extreme industrialization, dark-colored moths began to dominate.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">E. The recent increase of pale forms as pollution decreases supports the importance of natural selection by birds as a factor affecting peppered moth populations.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">F. Recent research indicates that when adult moths fail to choose appropriate backgrounds, they are usually eaten by birds.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Drag your answer choices to the space where they belong.
