<p><strong><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Memphis: United Egypt’s First Capital</span></strong></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">The city of Memphis, located on the Nile near the modern city of Cairo, was founded around 3100 B . C . as the first capital of a recently united Egypt. The choice of Memphis by Egypt’s first kings reflects the site’s strategic importance. First, and most obvious, the apex of the Nile River delta was a politically opportune location for the state’s administrative center, standing between the united lands of Upper and Lower Egypt and offering ready access to both parts of the country. The older predynastic (pre-3100BC) centers of power, This and Hierakonpolis, were too remote from the vast expanse of the delta, which had been incorporated into the unified state. Only a city within easy reach of both the Nile valley to the south and the more spread out, difficult terrain to the north could provide the necessary political control that the rulers of early dynastic Egypt (roughly 3000-2600 B . C . ) required.</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">1.The word vast in the passage is closest in meaning to</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">A. fertile</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">B. huge</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">C. unique</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">D. Irregular</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">2.According to paragraph 1, why was Memphis a better choice for the capital of a united Egypt than either This or Hierakonpolis</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">A. Memphis was in a better location for maintaining administrative control.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">B. Memphis had long been a regional administrative center by the time Egypt was united.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">C. This and Hierakonpolis had never actually been incorporated into the unified state.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">D. Egyptian rulers had failed to keep political control over This and Hierakonpolis in predynastic times.</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">3. Which of the following best describes how paragraph 1 is organized</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">A. Two simultaneous developments are described, as well as the reasons why neither one would have occurred without the other.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">B. A hypothesis is presented, and then points in favor of that hypothesis as well as points against it are discussed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">C. A major event is described, and then the most obvious effects of that event are presented.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">D. A decision is described, and then one likely motivation for that decision is presented.</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">4.It can be inferred from paragraph 1 that one consequence of the unification of Egypt was</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">A.the reduction of the strategic importance of older centers of power&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">B.the opportunity for the recently united Egypt to become economically self-sufficient&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">C.the increase in political tensions between the rulers of Upper and Lower Egypt&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">D.the reduction of Egypt&#39;s dependence upon the Nile for trade and communications</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">The region of Memphis must have also served as an important node for transport and communications, even before the unification of Egypt. The region probably acted as a conduit for much, if not all, of the river-based trade between northern and southern Egypt. Moreover, commodities (such as wine, precious oils, and metals) imported from the Near East by the royal courts of predynastic Upper Egypt would have been channeled through the Memphis region on their way south. 【In short, therefore, the site of Memphis offered the rulers of the Early Dynastic Period an ideal location for controlling internal trade within their realm, an essential requirement for a state-directed economy that depended on the movement of goods.】</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">5.&nbsp; According to paragraph 2, when did Egypt import goods from the Near East</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">A. Once internal trade was fully controlled from Memphis</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">B.&nbsp; Not until early dynastic Egypt established its state-directed economy</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">C. As early as predynastic times</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">D. Only when local supplies of those goods had been completely used up</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">6. Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the highlighted sentence in the passage Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">【In short, therefore, the site of Memphis offered the rulers of the Early Dynastic Period an ideal location for controlling internal trade within their realm, an essential requirement for a state-directed economy that depended on the movement of goods.】</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">A. Thus in Memphis, the rulers of the Early Dynastic Period were ideally placed to control internal trade, which they had to do in order to run their economy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">B.&nbsp; Therefore the rulers of the Early Dynastic Period thought Memphis was the ideal location for trade with nearby countries.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">C. In short, a state-directed economy like that of the Early Dynastic Period requires choosing a single location to which goods can be movedjaMemphis, in this case.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">D. In sum, then, a state-directed economy first developed during Egypt&#39;s Early Dynastic Period because Memphis was an ideal location for controlling trade.</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Equally important for the national administration was the ability to control communications within Egypt. The Nile provided the easiest and quickest artery of communication, and the national capital was, again, ideally located in this respect. Recent geological surveys of the Memphis region have revealed much about its topography in ancient times. It appears that the location of Memphis may have been even more advantageous for controlling trade, transport, and communications than was previously appreciated. Surveys and drill cores have shown that the level of the Nile floodplain has steadily risen over the last five millenniums. When the floodplain was much lower, as it would have been in predynastic and early dynastic times, the outwash fans (fan-shaped deposits of sediments) of various wadis (stream-beds or channels that carry water only during rainy periods) would have been much more prominent features on the east bank. The fan associated with the Wadi Hof extended a significant way into the Nile floodplain, forming a constriction in the vicinity of Memphis. The valley may have narrowed at this point to a mere three kilometers, making it the ideal place for controlling river traffic.</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">7. The word appreciated in the passage is closest in meaning to</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">A. proposed</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">B. understood</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">C. approved</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">D. Expected</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">8. The word vicinity in the passage is closest in meaning to</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">A. center</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">B. fields</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">C. city</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">D. surrounding area</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">9. According to paragraph 3, recent research into the topography of the Memphis region in ancient times suggests which of the following</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">A. The level of the Nile floodplains was much higher in predynastic and dynastic times than in later times.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">B. The sediment deposits of wadis were not as noticeable in predynastic and dynastic times than in later times.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">C. The Nile valley at the point of Memphis was narrower in predynastic and dynastic times than it was in later times.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">D. Frequent rainy periods may have caused a significant reduction of trade traffic during the predynastic and dynastic times.</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Furthermore, the Memphis region seems to have been favorably located for the control not only of river-based trade but also of desert trade routes. The two outwash fans in the area gave access to the extensive wadi systems of the eastern desert. In predynastic times, the Wadi Digla may have served as a trade route between the Memphis region and the Near East, to judge from the unusual concentration of foreign artifacts found in the predynastic settlement of Maadi. Access to, and control of, trade routes between Egypt and the Near East seems to have been a preoccupation of Egypt’s rulers during the period of state formation. The desire to monopolize foreign trade may have been one of the primary factors behind the political unification of Egypt. The foundation of the national capital at the junction of an important trade route with the Nile valley is not likely to have been accidental. Moreover, the Wadis Hof and Digla provided the Memphis region with accessible desert pasturage. As was the case with the cities of Hierakonpolis and Elkab, the combination within the same area of both desert pasturage and alluvial arable land (land suitable for growing crops) was a particularly attractive one for early settlement; this combination no doubt contributed to the prosperity of the Memphis region from early predynastic times.</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">10. According to paragraph 4, which of the following is NOT a reason Memphis was chosen as the capital of a united Egypt</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">A. It was at the junction of a major trade route with the Nile valley.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">B. It was near land that could be used for animal grazing and for growing crops.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">C. The nearby outwash fans led into wadis that could be used as desert trade routes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">D.Since foreign traders had settled in nearby Maadi, trade between the two cities could be established.</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">11. The phrase to have been accidental in the passage is closest in meaning to</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">A. to have gone wrong&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">B, to have been helpful&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">C. to have occurred by chance&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">D. to have made a difference</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">12. In paragraph 4, why does the author mention the cities of Hierakonpolis and Elkab</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">A. To give an indication of the level of prosperity that Memphis is thought to have enjoyed from its earliest days</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">B, To compare the Memphis region to them in terms of their similar combinations of characteristics providing advantages for early settlement</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">C. To identify the models that the founders of Memphis followed in laying out the national capital&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">D. To suggest that the combination of desert pasturage and alluvial arable land in the same area was very common</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">13. Look at the four squares that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage.</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">While considerations of political power and ease of administration were decisive in choosing the location of the new capital, the site clearly had other advantages.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Where would the sentence best fit Click on a square to add the sentence to the passage.</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Paragraph 2:</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">【A】The region of Memphis must have also served as an important node for transport and communications, even before the unification of Egypt. 【B】The region probably acted as a conduit for much, if not all, of the river-based trade between northern and southern Egypt. 【C】Moreover, commodities (such as wine, precious oils, and metals) imported from the Near East by the royal courts of predynastic Upper Egypt would have been channeled through the Memphis region on their way south.【D】 In short, therefore, the site of Memphis offered the rulers of the Early Dynastic Period an ideal location for controlling internal trade within their realm, an essential requirement for a state-directed economy that depended on the movement of goods.</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">14.&nbsp; Drag your choices to the spaces where they belong. To review the passage, click on View Text. Answer Choices</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">A. River-based trade from northern Egypt and imported goods going south all passed through the Memphis region, making Memphis an ideal location for controlling trade.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">B. After Memphis became the capital city, river-based trade along the Nile gained in importance, while land-based desert trade declined in importance.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">C. Recent geological surveys suggest that the topographical features of the Memphis region made it particularly well-suited for controlling communications and trade.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">D. The Nile, despite a constriction of its valley near Memphis, was the most advantageous route for communication and travel once the floodplain had begun to rise.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">E. The rulers of unified Egypt enjoyed a monopoly over foreign trade because all such trade was required to go through the Wadi Digla, to which the rulers controlled all access.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">F. While the location of Memphis was agriculturally favorable, it was particularly attractive because it enabled Egypt&#39;s rulers to control trade moving through the desert from the Near East.</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;"><br/></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;"><br/></span></p><p><strong><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Surface Fluids on Venus and Earth</span></strong></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">A fluid is a substance, such as a liquid or gas, in which the component particles (usually molecules) can move past one another. Fluids flow easily and conform to the shape of their containers. The geologic processes related to the movement of fluids on a planet’s surface can completely resurface a planet many times. These processes derive their energy from the Sun and the gravitational forces of the planet itself. As these fluids interact with surface materials, they move particles about or react chemically with them to modify or produce materials. On a solid planet with a rocky core and an atmosphere, only a tiny fraction of the planetary mass flows as surface fluids. Yet the movements of these fluids can drastically alter a planet. Consider Venus and Earth, both terrestrial planets with atmospheres.</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">1. The word modify in the passage is closest in meaning to</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">A. obtain</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">B. change</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">C. replace</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">D. absorb</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">2. The word drastically in the passage is closest in meaning to</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">A. gradually</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">B. permanently</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">C. extensively</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">D. Possibly</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">3. Paragraph 1 supports all of the following statements about fluids EXCEPT:</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">A. They can chemically react with particles on a planet&#39;s surface.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">B. Most of their mass does not flow but remains in place.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">C. Their movement can reshape the surface of certain kinds of planets.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">D. Their movement is driven by the Sun and by gravity.</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Venus and Earth are commonly regarded as twin planets but not identical twins. They are about the same size, are composed of roughly the same mix of materials, and may have been comparably endowed at their beginning with carbon dioxide and water. However, the twins evolved differently, largely because of differences in their distance from the Sun. With a significant amount of internal heat, Venus may continue to be geologically active with volcanoes, rifting, and folding. However, it lacks any sign of a hydrologic system (water circulation and distribution): there are no streams, lakes, oceans, or glaciers. Space probes suggest that Venus may have started with as much water as Earth, but it was unable to keep its water in liquid form. Because Venus receives more heat from the Sun, water released from the interior evaporated and rose to the upper atmosphere where the Sun’s ultraviolet rays broke the molecules apart. Much of the freed hydrogen escaped into space, and Venus lost its water. Without water, Venus became less and less like Earth and kept an atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide acts as a blanket, creating an intense greenhouse effect and driving surface temperatures high enough to melt lead and to prohibit the formation of carbonate minerals. Volcanoes continually vented more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. On Earth, liquid water removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and combines it with calcium, from rock weathering, to form carbonate sedimentary rocks. Without liquid water to remove carbon from the atmosphere, the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of Venus remains high.</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">4. The word prohibit in the passage is closest in meaning to</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">A. prevent&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">B. speed up&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">C. affect&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">D. Encourage</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">5. According to paragraph 2, what is one difference between Earth and Venus</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">A. Earth has less water in its atmosphere than Venus does.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">B. Earth has a hydrologic system, but Venus does not.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">C. Earth is less geologically active than Venus is.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">D. Earth has more carbon dioxide than Venus does.</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">6. It can be inferred from paragraph 2 that Earth evolved differently than Venus did in part because</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">A. there was more volcanic activity on early Venus than on early Earth</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">B. they received different amounts of solar energy</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">C. their interiors contained different amounts of heat</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">D. their early atmospheres contained different levels of oxygen and nitrogen</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">7. According to paragraph 2, all of the following played a role in keeping carbon dioxide levels high in the atmosphere of Venus EXCEPT</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">A. the breaking apart of water molecules by ultraviolet rays&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">B. the evaporation of water released from the planet&#39;s interior&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">C. the escape of hydrogen into space&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">D. the release of molecules from melting metals such as lead</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Like Venus, Earth is large enough to be geologically active and for its gravitational field to hold an atmosphere. Unlike Venus, it is just the right distance from the Sun so that temperature ranges allow water to exist as a liquid, a solid, and a gas. Water is thus extremely mobile and moves rapidly over the planet in a continuous hydrologic cycle. Heated by the Sun, the water moves in great cycles from the oceans to the atmosphere, over the landscape in river systems, and ultimately back to the oceans. As a result, Earth’s surface has been continually changed and eroded into delicate systems of river valleys—a remarkable contrast to the surfaces of other planetary bodies where impact craters dominate. Few areas on Earth have been untouched by flowing water. As a result, river valleys are the dominant feature of its landscape. Similarly, wind action has scoured fine particles away from large areas, depositing them elsewhere as vast sand seas dominated by dunes or in sheets of loess (fine-grained soil deposits). These fluid movements are caused by gravity flow systems energized by heat from the Sun. Other geologic changes occur when the gases in the atmosphere or water react with rocks at the surface to form new chemical compounds with different properties. An important example of this process was the removal of most of Earth’s carbon dioxide from its atmosphere to form carbonate rocks. However, if Earth were a little closer to the Sun, its oceans would evaporate; if it were farther from the Sun, the oceans would freeze solid. 【Because liquid water was present, self-replicating molecules of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen developed life early in Earth’s history and have radically modified its surface, blanketing huge parts of the continents with greenery.】 Life thrives on this planet, and it helped create the planet’s oxygen- and nitrogen-rich atmosphere and moderate temperatures.</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">8.

Although Venus is about the same size as Earth, its greater volcanic activity has added considerably to carbon dioxide levels in its atmosphere.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">B. Because Venus lost the water it originally had, most of its carbon dioxide remained in its atmosphere, causing the planet to become very warm.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">C.

In Europe as a whole, the population rose from 188 million in 1800 to 400 million in 1900. By 1900, virtually every area of Europe had contributed to the tremendous surge of population, but each major region was at a different stage of demographic change.</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">1. According to paragraph 1, which of the following is true about Europe in the nineteenth century?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">A. A large increase in food production led to industrialization.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">B. Population changes occurred at the same pace in the major regions.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">C. The standard of living rose to the level of that in most parts of the world.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">D. The tremendous rise in population led to greater agricultural output in every region.</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Paragraph 2</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Improvements in the food supply continued trends that had started in the late seventeenth century. New lands were put under cultivation, while the use of crops of American origin, particularly the potato, continued to expand. Setbacks did occur. Regional agricultural failures were the most common cause of economic recessions until 1850, and they could lead to localized famine as well. A major potato blight (disease) in 1846-1847 led to the deaths of at least one million persons in Ireland and the emigration of another million, and Ireland never recovered the population levels the potato had sustained to that point. Bad grain harvests at the same time led to increased hardship throughout much of Europe.</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">2. According to paragraph 2, which of the following caused the food supply to increase in most of Western Europe during the nineteenth century?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">A. Replacement of seventeenth-century farming techniques with more modern ones</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">B. Improved grain harvests in most European countries</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">C. Reduced demand for food as a result of a decreased population</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">D. Use of new land to grow crops</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">3. In paragraph 2, why does the author mention the potato blight that occurred in Ireland?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">A. To identify a crop that was more successful in the United State than it was in Western Europe</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">B. To support a claim about regional agricultural failures</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">C. To give an example of a problematic trend that had started in the late seventeenth century</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">D. To provide evidence that many countries in Europe experienced a loss of population in the nineteenth century</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Paragraph 3</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">After 1850, however, the expansion of foods more regularly kept pace with population growth, though the poorer classes remained malnourished. Two developments were crucial. First, the application of science and new technology to agriculture increased. Led by German universities, increasing research was devoted to improving seeds, developing chemical fertilizers, and advancing livestock. After 1861, with the development of land-grant universities in the United States that had huge agricultural programs,</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">American crop-production research added to this mix. Mechanization included the use of horse-drawn harvesters and seed drills, many developed initially in the United States. It also included mechanical cream separators and other food-processing devices that improved supply.</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">4. The phrase “kept pace with” in the passage is closest in meaning to</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">A. exceeded</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">B. matched the increase in</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">C. increased the rate of</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">D. caused</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">5. According to paragraph 3, all of the following factors helped the supply of food meet the needs of a growing population EXCEPT</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">A. increased agricultural research in Germany</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">B. introduction of new crops</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">C. development of food-processing devices</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">D. agricultural programs in universities in the United States</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Paragraph 4</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">The second development involved industrially based transportation. With trains and steam shipping, it became possible to move foods to needy regions within Western Europe quickly. Famine (as opposed to malnutrition) became a thing of the past. Many Western European countries, headed by Britain, began also to import increasing amounts of food, not only from Eastern Europe, a traditional source, but also from the Americas, Australia, and New Zealand. Steam shipping, which improved speed and capacity, as well as new procedures for canning and refrigerating foods (particularly after 1870), was fundamental to these developments.</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">6. The word “capacity” in the passage is closest in meaning to</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">A. variety of goods</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">B. distance</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">C. reliability</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">D. available storage space</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">7. According to paragraph 4, famine became less of a problem in Western Europe during the nineteenth century because of</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">A. the decline of malnutrition</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">B. the construction of more food-storage facilities</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">C. faster means of transportation</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">D. improved agricultural methods in Eastern Europe</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Paragraph 5</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Europe’s population growth included on additional innovation by the nineteenth century: it combined with rapid urbanization. More and more Western Europeans moved from countryside to city, and big cities grew most rapidly of all. By 1850, over half of all the people in England lived in cities, a first in human history. In one sense, this pattern seems inevitable growing numbers of people pressed available resources on the land, even when farmwork was combined with a bit of manufacturing, so people crowded into cities seeking work or other resources. Traditionally, however, death rates in cities surpassed those in the countryside by a large margin, cities had maintained population only through steady in-migration. Thus rapid urbanization should have reduced overall population growth, but by the middle of the nineteenth century this was no longer the case. Urban death rates remained high, particularly in the lower-class slums, but they began to decline rapidly.</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">8. The word “inevitable” in the passage is closest in meaning to</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">A. unexplainable</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">B. undesirable</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">C. unavoidable</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">D. unpredictable</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">9. According to paragraph 5, which of the following factors led to rapid urbanization in the first half of the nineteenth century?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">A. The destruction of many farms due to bad harvests</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">B. The reduction in the amount of good-quality farmland</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">C. The rise in death rates in the countryside</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">D. The lack of jobs in the countryside</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Paragraph 6</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The greater reliability of food supplies was a factor in the decline of urban death rates. Even more important were the gains in urban sanitation, as well as measures such as inspection of housing. Reformers, including enlightened doctors, began to study the causes of high death rates and to urge remediation. Even before the discovery of germs, beliefs that disease spread by “miasmas” (noxious forms of bad air) prompted attention to sewers and open garbage. Edwin Chadwick led an exemplary urban crusade for underground sewers in England in the 1830s. Gradually, public health provisions began to cut into customary urban mortality rates. By 1900, in some parts of Western Europe life expectancy in the cities began to surpass that of the rural areas. Industrial societies had figured out ways to combine large and growing cities with population growth, a development that would soon spread to other parts of the world.</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">10. The word “ surpass” in the passage is closest in meaning to</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">A. exceed</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">B. influence</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">C. equal</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">D. differ from</span></p><p><br/></p><p><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">11.
