<h1>综合写作</h1><h2>Reading Material<br/></h2><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.75em;"><span style="font-family: -apple-system, &quot;San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;PingFang SC&quot;, &quot;Hiragino Sans GB&quot;, STHeiti, &quot;Microsoft Yahei&quot;, &quot;Microsoft JhengHei&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans SC&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans CJK SC&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans CN&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans SC&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans TC&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans CJK TC&quot;, &quot;WenQuanYi Micro Hei&quot;, 驿微米黑, SimSun, sans-serif;">Pterosaurs were an ancient group of winged reptiles that lived alongside the dinosaurs. Many pterosaurs were very large, some as large as a giraffe and with a wingspan of over 12 meters. Paleontologists have long wondered whether large pterosaurs were capable of powered flight (flying by flapping their wings) or whether they were able only to glide. Several arguments have been made against powered flight.</span><br/><br/><span style="font-family: -apple-system, &quot;San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;PingFang SC&quot;, &quot;Hiragino Sans GB&quot;, STHeiti, &quot;Microsoft Yahei&quot;, &quot;Microsoft JhengHei&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans SC&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans CJK SC&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans CN&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans SC&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans TC&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans CJK TC&quot;, &quot;WenQuanYi Micro Hei&quot;, 驿微米黑, SimSun, sans-serif;">Doubters point out that since modern reptiles are cold-blooded, ancient reptiles such as pterosaurs were probably cold-blooded as well. Cold-blooded animals typically have a slow metabolism and are unable to produce a lot of energy. Powered flight is an activity requiring a lot of energy, which is why all modern vertebrates that fly are warm-blooded, not cold-blooded. It seemed unlikely that pterosaurs would have been able to generate the energy needed to fly.</span><br/><br/><span style="font-family: -apple-system, &quot;San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;PingFang SC&quot;, &quot;Hiragino Sans GB&quot;, STHeiti, &quot;Microsoft Yahei&quot;, &quot;Microsoft JhengHei&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans SC&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans CJK SC&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans CN&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans SC&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans TC&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans CJK TC&quot;, &quot;WenQuanYi Micro Hei&quot;, 驿微米黑, SimSun, sans-serif;">Second, there is a limit to the weight of animals that can be kept airborne by powered flight. Pterosaurs that were as large as a giraffe were probably so heavy that they would not have been able to flap their wings fast enough to stay aloft for any length of time.</span><br/><br/><span style="font-family: -apple-system, &quot;San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;PingFang SC&quot;, &quot;Hiragino Sans GB&quot;, STHeiti, &quot;Microsoft Yahei&quot;, &quot;Microsoft JhengHei&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans SC&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans CJK SC&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans CN&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans SC&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans TC&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans CJK TC&quot;, &quot;WenQuanYi Micro Hei&quot;, 驿微米黑, SimSun, sans-serif;">Third, all animals with powered flight are able to take off from the ground. For example, birds take off by jumping from their legs or running to gain speed and then jumping. But these methods would not have worked for large pterosaurs. Large pterosaurs would have needed big, powerful muscles in their back legs to launch themselves into the air, and we know from fossilized bones that their back leg muscles were too small and weak to allow the pterosaurs to run fast enough or jump high enough to launch themselves into the air.</span></p><h2>Lecture</h2><p><iframe src="https://iframe.xiaoeknow.com/page/?id=C8370B77-FDF1-5611-3193-6A04C5C77867&type=2" class="xiaoe-iframe-audio" height="72px" width="100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p><h1>独立写作</h1><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 13px; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; white-space: normal; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.75em;"><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5;">Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?</span></p><p class="p2" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; min-height: 15px; white-space: normal;"><br/></p><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 13px; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; white-space: normal; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.75em;"><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5;"><strong>It is important to know about events happening around the world, even if it is unlikely that they will affect your daily life.</strong></span></p><p class="p2" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; min-height: 15px; white-space: normal;"><br/></p><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 13px; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; white-space: normal; text-align: justify; line-height: 1.75em;"><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5;">Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.</span></p>
