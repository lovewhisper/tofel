In the formation of many species, the initial isolation of a population seems to have been a geographic barrier This mode of evolving new species is called allopatric speciation.</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">  Many factors can isolate a population geographically.A mountain range may emerge and gradually split a population of organisms that can inhabit only lowland lakes, certain fish populations might become isolated in this way. Similarity, a creeping glacier may gradually divide a population, or a land bridge such as the Isthmus of Panama may form and separate the marine life in the ocean waters on either side.</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">  How formidable must a geographic barrier be to keep populations apart? It depends on the ability of the organisms to move across barriers.Birds and coyotes can easily cross mountains and rivers. The passage of wind-blown tree pollen is also not hindered by such barriers, and the seeds of many plants may be earned back and forth on animals In contrast, small rodents may find a deep canyon or a wide river an effective barrier. For example, the Grand Canyon, in the southwestern United Slates, separate the range of the while-tailed antelope squirrel from that of the closely related Harris’ antelope squirrel. Smaller, with a shorter tail that is white underneath, the white-tailed antelope squirrel inhabits deserts north of the canyon and west of the Colorado River in southern California Hams&#39; antelope squirrel has a more limited range in deserts south of the Grand Canyon.</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">  Geographic isolation creates opportunities for new species to develop, but it does not necessarily lead to new species because speciation occurs only when the gene pool undergoes enough changes to establish reproductive barriers between the isolated population and its parent population.The likelihood of allopatric speciation increases when a population is small as well as isolated, making it more likely than a large population to have its gene pool changed substantially. For example,in less than two million years, small populations of stray animals and plants from the South American mainland that managed to colonize the Galapagos Islands gave rise to all the species that now inhabit the islands.</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">  When oceanic islands are far enough apart to permit populations to evolve in isolation, but close enough to allow occasional dispersions to occur, they are effectively outdoor laboratories of evolution.The Galapagos island chain is one of the world s greatest showcases of evolution Each island was born from underwater volcanoes and was gradually covered by organisms derived from strays that rode the ocean currents and winds from other islands and continents. Organisms can also be carried to islands by other organisms, such as sea birds that travel long distances with seeds clinging to their feathers.</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">  The species on the Galapagos Islands today, most of which occur nowhere else, descended from organisms that floated, flew, or were blown over the sea from the South American mainland For instance, the Galapagos island chain has a total of thirteen species of closely related birds called Galapagos finches These birds have many similarities but differ in their feeding habits and&nbsp;their beak type, which is correlated with what they eat Accumulated evidence indicates that all thirteen finch species evolved from a single small population of ancestral birds that colonized one of the islands.Completely isolated on the island after migrating from the mainland, the founder population may have undergone significant changes in its gene pool and become a new species. Later, a few individuals of this new species may have been blown by storms to a neighboring island. Isolated on this second island, the second founder population could have evolved into a second new species, which could later recolonize the island from which its founding population emigrated.Today each Galapagos island has multiple species of finches, with as many as ten on some islands.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">  </span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">paragraph 1</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">  Biologist Ernst Mayr defined a species as “an actually or potentially interbreeding population that does not interbreed with other such populations when there is opportunity to do so.” A <strong>key</strong> event in the origin of many species is the separation of a population with its gene pool (all of the genes in a population at any one time) from other populations of the same species, thereby preventing population interbreeding With its gene pool isolated, a separate population can follow its own evolutionary course.

Many explanations have been proposed for why dinosaurs became extinct. For example, some have blamed dinosaur extinction on the development of flowering plants, which were supposedly more difficult to digest and could have caused constipation or indigestion—except that flowering plants first evolved in the Early Cretaceous, about 60 million years before the dinosaurs died out. In fact, several scientists have suggested that the duckbill dinosaurs and homed dinosaurs, with their complex battery of grinding teeth, evolved to exploit this new resource of rapidly growing flowering plants Others have blamed extinction on competition from the mammals, which allegedly ate all the dinosaur eggs—except that mammals and dinosaurs appeared at the same time in the Late Triassic, about 190 million years ago, and there is no reason to believe that mammals suddenly acquired a taste for dinosaur eggs after 120 million years of coexistence Some explanations (such as the one stating that dinosaurs all died of diseases) fail because there is no way to scientifically test them, and they cannot move beyond the realm of speculation and guesswork.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;"><br/></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">  This focus on explaining dinosaur extinction misses an important point the extinction at the end of the Cretaceous was a global event that killed off organisms up and down the food chain. It wiped out many kinds of plankton in the ocean and many marine organisms that lived on the plankton at the base of the food chain. These included a variety of clams and snails, and especially the ammonites, a group of shelled squidlike creatures that dominated the Mesozoic seas and had survived many previous mass extinctions. The K-T event marked the end of the marine reptiles, such as the mosasaurs and the plesiosaurs, which were the largest creatures that had ever lived in the seas and which ruled the seas long before whales evolved. On land, there was also a crisis among the land plants, in addition to the disappearance of dinosaurs. So any event that can explain the destruction of the base of the food chain (plankton in the ocean, plants on land) can better explain what happened to organisms at the top of the food chain, such as the dinosaurs. By contrast, any explanation that focuses strictly on the dinosaurs completely misses the point The Cretaceous extinctions were a global phenomenon, and dinosaurs were just a part of a bigger picture.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;"><br/></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">  According to one theory, the Age of Dinosaurs ended suddenly 65 million years ago when a giant rock from space plummeted to Earth. Estimated to be ten to fifteen kilometers in diameter, this bolide (either a comet or an asteroid) was traveling at cosmic speeds of 20-70 kilometers per second, or 45,000-156,000 miles per hour. Such a huge mass traveling at such tremendous speeds carries an enormous amount of energy. When the bolide struck this energy was released and generated a huge shock wave that leveled everything for thousands of kilometers around the impact and caused most of the landscape to burst into flames. The bolide struck an area of the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico known as Chicxulub, excavating a crater 15-20 kilometers deep and at least 170 kilometers in diameter. The impact displaced huge volumes of seawater, causing much flood damage in the Caribbean. Meanwhile, the bolide itself excavated 100 cubic kilometers of rock and debris from the site, which rose to an altitude of 100 kilometers. Most of it fell back immediately, but some of it remained as dust in the atmosphere for months. This material, along with the smoke from the fires,&nbsp;shrouded Earth, creating a form of nuclear winter. According to computerized climate models, global temperatures fell to near the freezing point, photosynthesis halted, and most plants on land and in the sea died.

[■] Many explanations have been proposed for why dinosaurs became extinct. [■] For example, some have blamed dinosaur extinction on the development of flowering plants, which were supposedly more difficult to digest and could have caused constipation or indigestion—except that flowering plants first evolved in the Early Cretaceous, about 60 million years before the dinosaurs died out. [■]In fact, several scientists have suggested that the duckbill dinosaurs and homed dinosaurs, with their complex battery of grinding teeth, evolved to exploit this new resource of rapidly growing flowering plants. [■]Others have blamed extinction on competition from the mammals, which allegedly ate all the dinosaur eggs—except that mammals and dinosaurs appeared at the same time in the Late Triassic, about 190 million years ago, and there is no reason to believe that mammals suddenly acquired a taste for dinosaur eggs after 120 million years of coexistence Some explanations (such as the one stating that dinosaurs all died of diseases) fail because there is no way to scientifically test them, and they cannot move beyond the realm of speculation and guesswork.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;"> </span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;"> 14.

Callisto, the outermost of Jupiter&#39;s four largest satellites, orbits the planet in seventeen days at a distance from Jupiter of two million kilometers. Like our own Moon. Callisto rotates in the same period as it revolves, so it always keeps the same face toward Jupiter. Its noontime surface temperature is only about -140°C, so water ice is stable on its surface year-round. Callisto has a diameter of 4.820 kilometers, almost the same as that of Mercury. Its mass is only one-third as great, which means its density must be only one-third as great as well. This tells us that Callisto has far less of the rocky metallic materials found in the inner planets and must instead be an icy body through much of its interior.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;"><br/></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">  Callisto has not fully differentiated, meaning separated into layers of different density materials. Astronomers can tell that it lacks a dense core from the details of its gravitational pull on the Galileo spacecraft during several very close flybys. This fact surprised scientists, who expected that all the big icy moons would be differentiated. It is much easier for an icy body to differentiate than for a rocky one, since the melting temperature of ice is so low. Only a little heating will soften the ice and get the process started, allowing the rock and metal to sink to the center and the slushy ice to float to the surface. Yet Callisto seems to have frozen solid before the process of differentiation was complete.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;"><br/></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">  Like our Moon&#39;s highlands, the surface of Callisto is covered with impact craters. The survival of these craters tells us that an icy object can form and retain impact craters m its surface. In thinking of ice so far from the Sun, it is important not to judge its behavior from that of the much warmer ice we know on Earth; at the temperatures of the outer solar system, ice on the surface is nearly as hard as rock, and behaves similarly. Ice on Callisto does not deform or flow like ice in glaciers on Earth. Callisto is unique among the planet-sized objects of the solar system in its absence of interior forces to drive geological evolution. The satellite was born dead and has remained geologically dead for more than four billion years.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;"><br/></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">  Ganymede, another of Jupiter&#39;s satellites and the largest in our solar system, is also cratered, but less so than Callisto. About one-quarter of its surface seems to be as old and heavily cratered; the rest formed more recently, as we can tell by the sparse covering of impact craters as well as the relative freshness of the craters. Ganymede is a differentiated world, like the terrestrial planets. Measurements of its gravity field tell us that the rock and metal sank to form a core about the size of our Moon, with a mantle and crust of ice floating above it. In addition, the Galileo spacecraft discovered that Ganymede has a magnetic field, the signature of a partially molten interior. Ganymede is not a dead world, but rather a place of continuing geological activity powered by an internal heat source. Much of its surface may be as young as half a billion years.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;"><br/></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">  The younger terrain is the result of tectonic and volcanic forces Some features formed when the crust cracked, flooding many of the craters with water from the interior. Extensive mountain ranges were formed from compression of the crust, forming long ridges with parallel valleys spaced one to two kilometers apart. In some places older impact craters were split and pulled apart. There are even indications of large-scale crustal movements that are similar to the plate tectonics of Earth.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;"><br/></span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">  Why is Ganymede different from Callisto? Possibly the small difference in size and internal heating between the two led to this divergence in their evolution. But more likely the gravity of Jupiter is to blame for Ganymede&#39;s continuing geological activity. Ganymede is close enough to Jupiter that tidal forces from the giant planet may have episodically heated its interior and triggered major convulsions on its crust.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">  </span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">paragraph 1</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">  From 1996 to 1999, the Galileo spacecraft passed through the Jovian system, providing much information about Jupiter&#39;s satellites.

Paragraph 5 supports each of the following statements about Ganymede EXCEPT:</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">  A. All water on it has always been frozen solid.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">  B. There is evidence that part of its crust once broke open</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">  C. Its crust has been subject to forces that have created mountains and valleys.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">  D. Some of its older craters have been split apart by more recent geological activity</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">  </span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">paragraph 6</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">  Why is Ganymede different from Callisto? Possibly the small difference in size and internal heating between the two led to this divergence in their evolution. But more likely the gravity of Jupiter is to blame for Ganymede&#39;s continuing geological activity. Ganymede is close enough to Jupiter that tidal forces from the giant planet may have episodically heated its interior and triggered major convulsions on its crust.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">  </span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">11.

Click on square [■] to add the sentence to the passage</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">  Ganymede, another of Jupiter&#39;s satellites and the largest in our solar system, is also cratered, but less so than Callisto. [■] About one-quarter of its surface seems to be as old and heavily cratered; the rest formed more recently, as we can tell by the sparse covering of impact craters as well as the relative freshness of the craters. [■] Ganymede is a differentiated world, like the terrestrial planets. [■] Measurements of its gravity field tell us that the rock and metal sank to form a core about the size of our Moon, with a mantle and crust of ice floating above it. [■] In addition, the Galileo spacecraft discovered that Ganymede has a magnetic field, the signature of a partially molten interior. Ganymede is not a dead world, but rather a place of continuing geological activity powered by an internal heat source. Much of its surface may be as young as half a billion years.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">  </span></p><p style="text-align: justify; text-indent: 2em;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">13.
