<h1>综合写作</h1><h2>Reading Material</h2><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 13px; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; white-space: normal; line-height: 1.75em; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5;">Rembrandt is the most famous of the seventeenth-century Dutch painters. However, there are doubts whether some paintings attributed to Rembrandt were actually painted by him. One such painting is known as attributed to&nbsp;Rembrandt because of its style, and indeed the representation of the woman’s&nbsp;face is very much like that of portraits known to be by Rembrandt. But there are problems with the painting that suggest it could not be a work by Rembrandt.</span></p><p class="p2" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; min-height: 15px; white-space: normal;"><br/></p><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 13px; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; white-space: normal; line-height: 1.75em; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5;">First, there is something inconsistent about the way the woman in the portrait is dressed. She is wearing a white linen cap of a kind that only servants would wear-yet the coat she is wearing has a luxurious fur collar that no servant could afford. Rembrandt, who was known for his attention to the details of his&nbsp;subjects’ clothing, would not have been guilty of such inconsistency.</span></p><p class="p2" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; min-height: 15px; white-space: normal;"><br/></p><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 13px; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; white-space: normal; line-height: 1.75em; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5;">Second, Rembrandt was a master of painting light and shadow, but in this painting, these elements do not fit together. The face appears to be illuminated by light reflected onto it from below. But below the face is the dark fur collar, which would absorb light rather than reflect it. So the face should appear partially in shadow-which is not how it appears. Rembrandt would never have made such an error.</span></p><p class="p2" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; min-height: 15px; white-space: normal;"><br/></p><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 13px; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; white-space: normal; line-height: 1.75em; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5;">Finally, examination of the back of the painting reveals that it was painted on a panel made of several pieces of wood glued together. Although Rembrandt often painted on wood panels, no painting known to be by Rembrandt uses a panel glued together in this way from several pieces of wood. For these&nbsp;reasons, the painting was removed from the official catalog of Rembrandt’s&nbsp;paintings in the 1930s.</span></p><h2>Lecture</h2><p><iframe src="https://iframe.xiaoeknow.com/page/?id=C6A9F179-75F2-84CA-2080-4592C0D75AA5&type=2" class="xiaoe-iframe-audio" height="72px" width="100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p><h1>独立写作</h1><p style="line-height: 1.75em; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: -apple-system, &quot;San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;PingFang SC&quot;, &quot;Hiragino Sans GB&quot;, STHeiti, &quot;Microsoft Yahei&quot;, &quot;Microsoft JhengHei&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans SC&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans CJK SC&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans CN&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans SC&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans TC&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans CJK TC&quot;, &quot;WenQuanYi Micro Hei&quot;, 驿微米黑, SimSun, sans-serif;">Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?</span><br/><br/><span style="font-family: -apple-system, &quot;San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;PingFang SC&quot;, &quot;Hiragino Sans GB&quot;, STHeiti, &quot;Microsoft Yahei&quot;, &quot;Microsoft JhengHei&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans SC&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans CJK SC&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans CN&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans SC&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans TC&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans CJK TC&quot;, &quot;WenQuanYi Micro Hei&quot;, 驿微米黑, SimSun, sans-serif;">It is more important to keep your old friends than it is to make new friends.</span><br/><br/><span style="font-family: -apple-system, &quot;San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;PingFang SC&quot;, &quot;Hiragino Sans GB&quot;, STHeiti, &quot;Microsoft Yahei&quot;, &quot;Microsoft JhengHei&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans SC&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans CJK SC&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans CN&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans SC&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans TC&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans CJK TC&quot;, &quot;WenQuanYi Micro Hei&quot;, 驿微米黑, SimSun, sans-serif;">Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.</span></p>
