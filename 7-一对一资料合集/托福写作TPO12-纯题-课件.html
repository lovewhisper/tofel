<h1>综合写作</h1><h2>Reading Material</h2><span style="font-family: -apple-system, &quot;San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;PingFang SC&quot;, &quot;Hiragino Sans GB&quot;, STHeiti, &quot;Microsoft Yahei&quot;, &quot;Microsoft JhengHei&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans SC&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans CJK SC&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans CN&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans SC&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans TC&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans CJK TC&quot;, &quot;WenQuanYi Micro Hei&quot;, 驿微米黑, SimSun, sans-serif; text-align: justify;">Jane Austen (1775–1817) is one of the most famous of all English novelists, and today her novels are more popular than ever, with several recently adapted as Hollywood movies. But we do not have many records of what she looked like. For a long time, the only accepted image of Austen was an amateur sketch of an adult Austen made by her sister Cassandra. However, recently a professionally painted, full-length portrait of a teenage girl owned by a member of the Austen family has come up for sale. Although the professional painting is not titled Jane Austen, there are good reasons to believe she is the subject.</span><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.75em;"><br/><span style="font-family: -apple-system, &quot;San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;PingFang SC&quot;, &quot;Hiragino Sans GB&quot;, STHeiti, &quot;Microsoft Yahei&quot;, &quot;Microsoft JhengHei&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans SC&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans CJK SC&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans CN&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans SC&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans TC&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans CJK TC&quot;, &quot;WenQuanYi Micro Hei&quot;, 驿微米黑, SimSun, sans-serif;">First, in 1882, several decades after Austen&#39;s death, Austen&#39;s family gave permission to use the portrait as an illustration in an edition of her letters. Austen&#39;s family clearly recognized it as a portrait of the author. So, for over a century now, the Austen family itself has endorsed the claim that the girl in the portrait is Jane Austen.</span><br/><br/><span style="font-family: -apple-system, &quot;San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;PingFang SC&quot;, &quot;Hiragino Sans GB&quot;, STHeiti, &quot;Microsoft Yahei&quot;, &quot;Microsoft JhengHei&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans SC&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans CJK SC&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans CN&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans SC&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans TC&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans CJK TC&quot;, &quot;WenQuanYi Micro Hei&quot;, 驿微米黑, SimSun, sans-serif;">Second, the face in the portrait clearly resembles the one in Cassandra&#39;s sketch, which we know depicts Austen. Though somewhat amateurish, the sketch communicates definite details about Austen&#39;s face. Even though the Cassandra sketch is of an adult Jane Austen, the features are still similar to those of the teenage girl in the painting. The eyebrows, nose, mouth, and overall shape of the face are very much like those in the full-length portrait.</span><br/><br/><span style="font-family: -apple-system, &quot;San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;PingFang SC&quot;, &quot;Hiragino Sans GB&quot;, STHeiti, &quot;Microsoft Yahei&quot;, &quot;Microsoft JhengHei&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans SC&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans CJK SC&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans CN&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans SC&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans TC&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans CJK TC&quot;, &quot;WenQuanYi Micro Hei&quot;, 驿微米黑, SimSun, sans-serif;">Third, although the painting is unsigned and undated, there is evidence that it was painted when Austen was a teenager. The style links it to Ozias Humphrey, a society portrait painter who was the kind of professional the wealthy Austen family would hire. Humphrey was active in the late 1780s and early 1790s, exactly the period when Jane Austen was the age of the girl in the painting.</span></p><h2>Lecture</h2><p><iframe src="https://iframe.xiaoeknow.com/page/?id=5F4E31BD-C13C-FE3B-0AAD-E27400D1AB48&type=2" class="xiaoe-iframe-audio" height="72px" width="100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p><h1>独立写作</h1><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 13px; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; white-space: normal; line-height: 1.75em; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5;">Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?</span></p><p class="p2" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; min-height: 15px; white-space: normal;"><br/></p><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 13px; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; white-space: normal; line-height: 1.75em; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5;"><strong>It is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject.</strong></span></p><p class="p2" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; min-height: 15px; white-space: normal;"><br/></p><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 13px; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; white-space: normal; line-height: 1.75em; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5;">Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer.</span></p>
