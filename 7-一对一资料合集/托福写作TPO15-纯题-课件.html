<h1>综合写作</h1><h2>Reading Material</h2><p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.75em;"><span style="font-family: -apple-system, &quot;San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;PingFang SC&quot;, &quot;Hiragino Sans GB&quot;, STHeiti, &quot;Microsoft Yahei&quot;, &quot;Microsoft JhengHei&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans SC&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans CJK SC&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans CN&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans SC&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans TC&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans CJK TC&quot;, &quot;WenQuanYi Micro Hei&quot;, 驿微米黑, SimSun, sans-serif;">The cane toad is a large (1.8 kg) amphibian species native to Central and South America. It was deliberately introduced to Australia in 1935 with the expectation that it would protect farmers&#39; crops by eating harmful insects. Unfortunately, the toad multiplied rapidly, and a large cane toad population now threatens small native animals that are not pests. Several measures have been proposed to stop the spread of the cane toad in Australia.</span><br/><br/><span style="font-family: -apple-system, &quot;San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;PingFang SC&quot;, &quot;Hiragino Sans GB&quot;, STHeiti, &quot;Microsoft Yahei&quot;, &quot;Microsoft JhengHei&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans SC&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans CJK SC&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans CN&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans SC&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans TC&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans CJK TC&quot;, &quot;WenQuanYi Micro Hei&quot;, 驿微米黑, SimSun, sans-serif;">One way to prevent the spread of the toad would be to build a national fence. A fence that blocks the advance of the toads will prevent them from moving into those parts of Australia that they have not yet colonized. This approach has been used before: a national fence was erected in the early part of the twentieth century to prevent the spread of rabbits, another animal species that was introduced in Australia from abroad and had a harmful impact on its native ecosystems.</span><br/><br/><span style="font-family: -apple-system, &quot;San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;PingFang SC&quot;, &quot;Hiragino Sans GB&quot;, STHeiti, &quot;Microsoft Yahei&quot;, &quot;Microsoft JhengHei&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans SC&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans CJK SC&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans CN&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans SC&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans TC&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans CJK TC&quot;, &quot;WenQuanYi Micro Hei&quot;, 驿微米黑, SimSun, sans-serif;">Second, the toads could be captured and destroyed by volunteers. Cane toads can easily be caught in simple traps and can even be captured by hand. Young toads and cane toad eggs are even easier to gather and destroy, since they are restricted to the water. If the Australian government were to organize a campaign among Australian citizens to join forces to destroy the toads, the collective effort might stop the toad from spreading.</span><br/><br/><span style="font-family: -apple-system, &quot;San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;, Arial, &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;PingFang SC&quot;, &quot;Hiragino Sans GB&quot;, STHeiti, &quot;Microsoft Yahei&quot;, &quot;Microsoft JhengHei&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans SC&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans CJK SC&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans CN&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans SC&quot;, &quot;Source Han Sans TC&quot;, &quot;Noto Sans CJK TC&quot;, &quot;WenQuanYi Micro Hei&quot;, 驿微米黑, SimSun, sans-serif;">Third, researchers are developing a disease-causing virus to control the cane toad populations. This virus will be specially designed: although it will be able to infect a number of reptile and amphibian species, it will not harm most of the infected species; it will specifically harm only the cane toads. The virus will control the population of cane toads by preventing them from maturing and reproducing.</span></p><h2>Lecture</h2><p><iframe src="https://iframe.xiaoeknow.com/page/?id=73EB0C39-1AB8-A2F8-44BA-C2DB6D312284&type=2" class="xiaoe-iframe-audio" height="72px" width="100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></p><h1>独立写作</h1><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 13px; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; white-space: normal; line-height: 1.75em; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5;">Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?</span></p><p class="p2" style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 13px; line-height: normal; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; min-height: 16px; white-space: normal;"><br/></p><p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 13px; font-family: &quot;Helvetica Neue&quot;; white-space: normal; line-height: 1.75em; text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.5;"><strong>In order to become financially responsible adults, children should learn to manage their own money at a young age.</strong></span></p><p><br/></p>
