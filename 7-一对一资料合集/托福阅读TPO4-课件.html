<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">TPO-4</span></strong></p><p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Deer Populations of the Puget Sound</span></strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Two species of deer have been prevalent in the Puget Sound area of Washington State in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. The black-tailed deer, a lowland, west-side cousin of the mule deer of eastern Washington, is now the most common. The other species, the Columbian white-tailed deer, in earlier times was common in the open prairie country; it is now restricted to the low, marshy islands and flood plains along the lower Columbia River.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Nearly any kind of plant of the forest understory can be part of a deer&#39;s diet. Where the forest inhibits the growth of grass and other meadow plants, the black-tailed deer browses on huckleberry, salal, dogwood, and almost any other shrub or herb. But this is fair-weather feeding. What keeps the black-tailed deer alive in the harsher seasons of plant decay and dormancy? One compensation for not hibernating is the built-in urge to migrate. Deer may move from high-elevation browse areas in summer down to the lowland areas in late fall. Even with snow on the ground, the high bushy understory is exposed; also snow and wind bring down leafy branches of cedar, hemlock, red alder, and other arboreal fodder.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">The numbers of deer have fluctuated markedly since the entry of Europeans into Puget Sound country. The early explorers and settlers told of abundant deer in the early 1800s and yet almost in the same breath bemoaned the lack of this succulent game animal. Famous explorers of the north American frontier, Lewis and Clark arrived at the mouth of the Columbia River on November 14, 1805, in nearly starved circumstances. They had experienced great difficulty finding game west of the Rockies and not until the second of December did they kill their first elk. To keep 40 people alive that winter, they consumed approximately 150 elk and 20 deer. And when game moved out of the lowlands in early spring, the expedition decided to return east rather than face possible starvation. Later on in the early years of the nineteenth century, when Fort Vancouver became the headquarters of the Hudson&#39;s Bay Company, deer populations continued to fluctuate. David Douglas, Scottish botanical explorer of the 1830s, found a disturbing change in the animal life around the fort during the period between his first visit in 1825 and his final contact with the fort in 1832. A recent Douglas biographer states:&quot; The deer which once picturesquely dotted the meadows around the fort were gone [in 1832], hunted to extermination in order to protect the crops.&quot;&nbsp;</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Reduction in numbers of game should have boded ill for their survival in later times. A worsening of the plight of deer was to be expected as settlers encroached on the land, logging, burning, and clearing, eventually replacing a wilderness landscape with roads, cities, towns, and factories. No doubt the numbers of deer declined still further. Recall the fate of the Columbian white-tailed deer, now in a protected status. But for the black-tailed deer, human pressure has had just the opposite effect. Wildlife zoologist Helmut Buechner(1953), in reviewing the nature of biotic changes in Washington through recorded time, says that &quot;since the early 1940s, the state has had more deer than at any other time in its history, the winter population fluctuating around approximately 320,000 deer (mule and black-tailed deer), which will yield about 65,000 of either sex and any age annually for an indefinite period.&quot;&nbsp;</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">The causes of this population rebound are consequences of other human actions. First, the major predators of deer—wolves, cougar, and lynx—have been greatly reduced in numbers. Second, conservation has been insured by limiting times for and types of hunting. But the most profound reason for the restoration of high population numbers has been the fate of the forests. Great tracts of lowland country deforested by logging, fire, or both have become ideal feeding grounds of deer. In addition to finding an increase of suitable browse, like huckleberry and vine maple, Arthur Einarsen, longtime game biologist in the Pacific Northwest, found quality of browse in the open areas to be substantially more nutritive. The protein content of shade-grown vegetation, for example, was much lower than that for plants grown in clearings.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Paragraph 1: Two species of deer have been prevalent in the Puget Sound area of Washington State in the Pacific Northwest of the United States.

We might expect that early artistic efforts would be crude, but the cave paintings of Spain and southern France show a marked degree of skill. So do the naturalistic paintings on slabs of stone excavated in southern Africa. Some of those slabs appear to have been painted as much as 28,000 years ago, which suggests that painting in Africa is as old as painting in Europe. But painting may be even older than that. The early Australians may have painted on the walls of rock shelters and cliff faces at least 30,000 years ago, and maybe as much as 60,000 years ago.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">The researchers Peter Ucko and Andree Rosenfeld identified three principal locations of paintings in the caves of western Europe: (1) in obviously inhabited rock shelters and cave entrances; (2) in galleries immediately off the inhabited areas of caves; and (3) in the inner reaches of caves, whose difficulty of access has been interpreted by some as a sign that magical-religious activities were performed there.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">The subjects of the paintings are mostly animals. The paintings rest on bare walls, with no backdrops or environmental trappings. Perhaps, like many contemporary peoples, Upper Paleolithic men and women believed that the drawing of a human image could cause death or injury, and if that were indeed their belief, it might explain why human figures are rarely depicted in cave art. Another explanation for the focus on animals might be that these people sought to improve their luck at hunting. This theory is suggested by evidence of chips in the painted figures, perhaps made by spears thrown at the drawings. But if improving their hunting luck was the chief motivation for the paintings, it is difficult to explain why only a few show signs of having been speared.

The data they present suggest that the animals portrayed in the cave paintings were mostly the ones that the painters preferred for meat and for materials such as hides. For example, wild cattle (bovines) and horses are portrayed more often than we would expect by chance, probably because they were larger and heavier (meatier) than other animals in the environment. In addition, the paintings mostly portray animals that the painters may have feared the most because of their size, speed, natural weapons such as tusks and horns, and the unpredictability of their behavior. That is, mammoths, bovines, and horses are portrayed more often than deer and reindeer. Thus, the paintings are consistent with the idea that the art is related to the importance of hunting in the economy of Upper Paleolithic people. Consistent with this idea, according to the investigators, is the fact that the art of the cultural period that followed the Upper Paleolithic also seems to reflect how people got their food. But in that period, when getting food no longer depended on hunting large game animals (because they were becoming extinct), the art ceased to focus on portrayals of animals.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Upper Paleolithic art was not confined to cave paintings.

In addition to other artworks, figurines representing the human female in exaggerated form have also been found at Upper Paleolithic sites.

We might expect that early artistic efforts would be crude, but the cave paintings of Spain and southern France show a <span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5; background-color: rgb(216, 216, 216);">marked</span> degree of skill. So do the naturalistic paintings on slabs of stone excavated in southern Africa. Some of those slabs appear to have been painted as much as 28,000 years ago, which suggests that painting in Africa is as old as painting in Europe. But painting may be even older than that. The early Australians may have painted on the walls of rock shelters and cliff faces at least 30,000 years ago, and maybe as much as 60,000 years ago.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">1．The word “marked” in the passage is closest in meaning to&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○considerable&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○surprising&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○limited&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○adequate&nbsp;</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">2．Paragraph 1 supports which of the following statements about painting in Europe?&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○It is much older than painting in Australia.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○It is as much as 28,000 years old.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○It is not as old as painting in southern Africa.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○It is much more than 30,000 years old.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Paragraph 2: The researchers Peter Ucko and Andree Rosenfeld identified three <span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5; background-color: rgb(216, 216, 216);">principal </span>locations of paintings in the caves of western Europe: (1) in obviously inhabited rock shelters and cave entrances; (2) in galleries immediately off the inhabited areas of caves; and (3) in the inner reaches of caves, whose difficulty of access has been interpreted by some as a sign that magical-religious activities were performed there.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">3．The word “principal” in the passage is closest in meaning to&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○major&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○likely&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○well protected&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○distinct&nbsp;</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">4．According to paragraph 2, what makes some researchers think that certain cave paintings were connected with magical-religious activities?&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○The paintings were located where many people could easily see them, allowing groups of people to participate in the magical-religious activities.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○Upper Paleolithic people shared similar beliefs with contemporary peoples who use paintings of animals in their magical-religious rituals.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○Evidence of magical-religious activities has been found in galleries immediately off the inhabited areas of caves.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○The paintings were found in hard-to-reach places away from the inhabited parts of the cave.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Paragraph 3: The subjects of the paintings are mostly animals.

Microscopic organisms settle to the seafloor and accumulate in marine mud. The organic matter may partially decompose, using up the dissolved oxygen in the sediment. As soon as the oxygen is gone, decay stops and the remaining organic matter is preserved.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Continued sedimentation—the process of deposits’ settling on the sea bottom—buries the organic matter and subjects it to higher temperatures and pressures, which convert the organic matter to oil and gas. As muddy sediments are pressed together, the gas and small droplets of oil may be squeezed out of the mud and may move into sandy layers nearby. Over long periods of time (millions of years), accumulations of gas and oil can collect in the sandy layers. Both oil and gas are less dense than water, so they generally tend to rise upward through water-saturated rock and sediment.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Oil pools are valuable underground accumulations of oil, and oil fields are regions underlain by one or more oil pools. When an oil pool or field has been discovered, wells are drilled into the ground. Permanent towers, called derricks, used to be built to handle the long sections of drilling pipe. Now portable drilling machines are set up and are then dismantled and removed. When the well reaches a pool, oil usually rises up the well because of its density difference with water beneath it or because of the pressure of expanding gas trapped above it. Although this rise of oil is almost always carefully controlled today, spouts of oil, or gushers, were common in the past. Gas pressure gradually dies out, and oil is pumped from the well. Water or steam may be pumped down adjacent wells to help push the oil out. At a refinery, the crude oil from underground is separated into natural gas, gasoline, kerosene, and various oils. Petrochemicals such as dyes, fertilizer, and plastic are also manufactured from the petroleum.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">As oil becomes increasingly difficult to find, the search for it is extended into more-hostile environments. The development of the oil field on the North Slope of Alaska and the construction of the Alaska pipeline are examples of the great expense and difficulty involved in new oil discoveries. Offshore drilling platforms extend the search for oil to the ocean’s continental shelves—those gently sloping submarine regions at the edges of the continents. More than one-quarter of the world’s oil and almost one-fifth of the world’s natural gas come from offshore, even though offshore drilling is six to seven times more expensive than drilling on land. A significant part of this oil and gas comes from under the North Sea between Great Britain and Norway.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Of course, there is far more oil underground than can be recovered. It may be in a pool too small or too far from a potential market to justify the expense of drilling. Some oil lies under regions where drilling is forbidden, such as national parks or other public lands. Even given the best extraction techniques, only about 30 to 40 percent of the oil in a given pool can be brought to the surface. The rest is far too difficult to extract and has to remain underground.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Moreover, getting petroleum out of the ground and from under the sea and to the consumer can create environmental problems anywhere along the line. Pipelines carrying oil can be broken by faults or landslides, causing serious oil spills. Spillage from huge oil-carrying cargo ships, called tankers, involved in collisions or accidental groundings (such as the one off Alaska in 1989) can create oil slicks at sea. Offshore platforms may also lose oil, creating oil slicks that drift ashore and foul the beaches, harming the environment. Sometimes, the ground at an oil field may subside as oil is removed. The Wilmington field near Long Beach, California, has subsided nine meters in 50 years; protective barriers have had to be built to prevent seawater from flooding the area. Finally, the refining and burning of petroleum and its products can cause air pollution. Advancing technology and strict laws, however, are helping control some of these adverse environmental effects.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Paragraph 1: Petroleum, consisting of crude oil and natural gas, seems to originate from organic matter in marine sediment.

When an oil pool or field has been discovered, wells are drilled into the ground. Permanent towers, called derricks, used to be built to handle the long sections of drilling pipe. Now portable drilling machines are set up and are then dismantled and removed. When the well reaches a pool, oil usually rises up the well because of its density difference with water beneath it or because of the pressure of expanding gas trapped above it. Although this rise of oil is almost always carefully controlled today, spouts of oil, or gushers, were common in the past. Gas pressure gradually dies out, and oil is pumped from the well. Water or steam may be pumped down <span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5; background-color: rgb(216, 216, 216);">adjacent </span>wells to help push the oil out. At a refinery, the crude oil from underground is separated into natural gas, gasoline, kerosene, and various oils.

The development of the oil field on the North Slope of Alaska and the construction of the Alaska pipeline are examples of the great expense and difficulty involved in new oil discoveries. Offshore drilling platforms extend the search for oil to the ocean’s continental shelves—those gently <span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5; background-color: rgb(216, 216, 216);">sloping</span> submarine regions at the edges of the continents. More than one-quarter of the world’s oil and almost one-fifth of the world’s natural gas come from offshore, even though offshore drilling is six to seven times more expensive than drilling on land.

It may be in a pool too small or too far from a potential market to justify the expense of drilling. Some oil lies under regions where drilling is forbidden, such as national parks or other public lands. Even given the best extraction techniques, only about 30 to 40 percent of the oil in a given pool can be brought to the surface. The rest is far too difficult to extract and has to remain underground.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">10．According to paragraph 5, the decision to drill for oil depends on all of the following factors EXCEPT&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○permission to access the area where oil has been found&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○the availability of sufficient quantities of oil in a pool&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○the location of the market in relation to the drilling site&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○the political situation in the region where drilling would occur&nbsp;</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Paragraph 6: Moreover, getting petroleum out of the ground and from under the sea and to the consumer can create environmental problems anywhere along the line. Pipelines carrying oil can be broken by faults or landslides, causing serious oil spills. Spillage from huge oil-carrying cargo ships, called tankers, involved in collisions or accidental groundings (such as the one off Alaska in 1989) can create oil slicks at sea. Offshore platforms may also lose oil, creating oil slicks that drift ashore and <span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5; background-color: rgb(216, 216, 216);">foul</span> the beaches, harming the environment. Sometimes, the ground at an oil field may subside as oil is removed. The Wilmington field near Long Beach, California, has subsided nine meters in 50 years; protective barriers have had to be built to prevent seawater from flooding the area. Finally, the refining and burning of petroleum and its products can cause air pollution.
