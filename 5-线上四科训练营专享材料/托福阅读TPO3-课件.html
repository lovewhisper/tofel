Because architecture grows out of human needs and aspirations, it clearly communicates cultural values. Of all the visual arts, architecture affects our lives most directly for it determines the character of the human environment in major ways.</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Architecture is a three-dimensional form. It utilizes space, mass, texture, line, light, and color. To be architecture, a building must achieve a working harmony with a variety of elements. Humans instinctively seek structures that will shelter and enhance their way of life. It is the work of architects to create buildings that are not simply constructions but also offer inspiration and delight. Buildings contribute to human life when they provide shelter, enrich space, complement their site, suit the climate, and are economically feasible. The client who pays for the building and defines its function is an important member of the architectural team. The mediocre design of many contemporary buildings can be traced to both clients and architects.</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">In order for the structure to achieve the size and strength necessary to meet its purpose, architecture employs methods of support that, because they are based on physical laws, have changed little since people first discovered them—even while building materials have changed dramatically. The world’s architectural structures have also been devised in relation to the objective limitations of materials. Structures can be analyzed in terms of how they deal with downward forces created by gravity. They are designed to withstand the forces of compression (pushing together), tension (pulling apart), bending, or a combination of these in different parts of the structure.</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Even development in architecture has been the result of major technological changes. Materials and methods of construction are integral parts of the design of architecture structures. In earlier times it was necessary to design structural systems suitable for the materials that were available, such as wood, stone, brick. Today technology has progressed to the point where it is possible to invent new building materials to suit the type of structure desired. Enormous changes in materials and techniques of construction within the last few generations have made it possible to enclose space with much greater ease and speed and with a minimum of material. Progress in this area can be measured by the difference in weight between buildings built now and those of comparable size built one hundred years ago.</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Modern architectural forms generally have three separate components comparable to elements of the human body: a supporting skeleton or frame, an outer skin enclosing the interior spaces, and equipment, similar to the body’s vital organs and systems. The equipment includes plumbing, electrical wiring, hot water, and air-conditioning. Of course in early architecture—such as igloos and adobe structures—there was no such equipment, and the skeleton and skin were often one.</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Much of the world’s great architecture has been constructed of stone because of its beauty, permanence, and availability. In the past, whole cities grew from the arduous task of cutting and piling stone upon. Some of the world’s finest stone architecture can be seen in the ruins of the ancient Inca city of Machu Picchu high in the eastern Andes Mountains of Peru. The doorways and windows are made possible by placing over the open spaces thick stone beams that support the weight from above. A structural invention had to be made before the physical limitations of stone could be overcome and new architectural forms could be created. That invention was the arch, a curved structure originally made of separate stone or brick segments. The arch was used by the early cultures of the Mediterranean area chiefly for underground drains, but it was the Romans who first developed and used the arch extensively in aboveground structures. Roman builders perfected the semicircular arch made of separate blocks of stone. As a method of spanning space, the arch can support greater weight than a horizontal beam. It works in compression to divert the weight above it out to the sides, where the weight is borne by the vertical elements on either side of the arch. The arch is among the many important structural breakthroughs that have characterized architecture throughout the centuries.</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Paragraph 1: Architecture is the art and science of designing structures that organize and enclose space for practical and symbolic purposes.

This region has a semiarid climate, and for 50 years after its settlement, it supported a low-intensity agricultural economy of cattle ranching and wheat farming. In the early twentieth century, however, it was discovered that much of the High Plains was underlain by a huge aquifer (a rock layer containing large quantities of groundwater). This aquifer was named the Ogallala aquifer after the Ogallala Sioux Indians, who once inhabited the region.</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">The Ogallala aquifer is a sandstone formation that underlies some 583,000 square kilometers of land extending from northwestern Texas to southern South Dakota. Water from rains and melting snows has been accumulating in the Ogallala for the past 30,000 years. Estimates indicate that the aquifer contains enough water to fill Lake Huron, but unfortunately, under the semiarid climatic conditions that presently exist in the region, rates of addition to the aquifer are minimal, amounting to about half a centimeter a year.</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">The first wells were drilled into the Ogallala during the drought years of the early 1930s. The ensuing rapid expansion of irrigation agriculture, especially from the 1950s onward, transformed the economy of the region. More than 100,000 wells now tap the Ogallala. Modern irrigation devices, each capable of spraying 4.5 million liters of water a day, have produced a landscape dominated by geometric patterns of circular green islands of crops. Ogallala water has enabled the High Plains region to supply significant amounts of the cotton, sorghum, wheat, and corn grown in the United States. In addition, 40 percent of American grain-fed beef cattle are fattened here.</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">This unprecedented development of a finite groundwater resource with an almost negligible natural recharge rate—that is, virtually no natural water source to replenish the water supply—has caused water tables in the region to fall drastically. In the 1930s, wells encountered plentiful water at a depth of about 15 meters; currently, they must be dug to depths of 45 to 60 meters or more. In places, the water table is declining at a rate of a meter a year, necessitating the periodic deepening of wells and the use of ever-more-powerful pumps. It is estimated that at current withdrawal rates, much of the aquifer will run dry within 40 years. The situation is most critical in Texas, where the climate is driest, the greatest amount of water is being pumped, and the aquifer contains the least water. It is projected that the remaining Ogallala water will, by the year 2030, support only 35 to 40 percent of the irrigated acreage in Texas that is supported in 1980.</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">The reaction of farmers to the inevitable depletion of the Ogallala varies. Many have been attempting to conserve water by irrigating less frequently or by switching to crops that require less water. Others, however, have adopted the philosophy that it is best to use the water while it is still economically profitable to do so and to concentrate on high-value crops such as cotton. The incentive of the farmers who wish to conserve water is reduced by their knowledge that many of their neighbors are profiting by using great amounts of water, and in the process are drawing down the entire region’s water supplies.</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">In the face of the upcoming water supply crisis, a number of grandiose schemes have been developed to transport vast quantities of water by canal or pipeline from the Mississippi, the Missouri, or the Arkansas rivers. Unfortunately, the cost of water obtained through any of these schemes would increase pumping costs at least tenfold, making the cost of irrigated agricultural products from the region uncompetitive on the national and international markets. Somewhat more promising have been recent experiments for releasing capillary water (water in the soil) above the water table by injecting compressed air into the ground. Even if this process proves successful, however, it would almost triple water costs. Genetic engineering also may provide a partial solution, as new strains of drought-resistant crops continue to be developed. Whatever the final answer to the water crisis may be, it is evident that within the High Plains, irrigation water will never again be the abundant, inexpensive resource it was during the agricultural boom years of the mid-twentieth century.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Paragraph 1: The vast grasslands of the High Plains in the central United States were settled by farmers and ranchers in the 1880s.

Modern irrigation devices, each capable of spraying 4.5 million liters of water a day, have produced a landscape dominated by geometric patterns of circular green islands of crops. Ogallala water has enabled the High Plains region to supply significant amounts of the cotton, sorghum, wheat, and corn grown in the United States.

In the 1930s, wells encountered plentiful water at a depth of about 15 meters; currently, they must be dug to depths of 45 to 60 meters or more. In places, the water table is declining at a rate of a meter a year, necessitating the periodic deepening of wells and the use of ever-more-powerful pumps. It is estimated that at current withdrawal rates, much of the aquifer will run dry within 40 years. The situation is most critical in Texas, where the climate is driest, the greatest amount of water is being pumped, and the aquifer contains the least water. It is projected that the remaining Ogallala water will, by the year 2030, support only 35 to 40 percent of the irrigated acreage in Texas that is supported in 1980.</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">6.

Ecologists use the term “succession” to refer to the changes that happen in plant communities and ecosystems over time. The first community in a succession is called a pioneer community, while the long-lived community at the end of succession is called a climax community. Pioneer and successional plant communities are said to change over periods from 1 to 500 years. These changes—in plant numbers and the mix of species—are cumulative. Climax communities themselves change but over periods of time greater than about 500 years.</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">An ecologist who studies a pond today may well find it relatively unchanged in a year’s time. Individual fish may be replaced, but the number of fish will tend to be the same from one year to the next. We can say that the properties of an ecosystem are more stable than the individual organisms that compose the ecosystem.</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">At one time, ecologists believed that species diversity made ecosystems stable. They believed that the greater the diversity the more stable the ecosystem. Support for this idea came from the observation that long-lasting climax communities usually have more complex food webs and more species diversity than pioneer communities. Ecologists concluded that the apparent stability of climax ecosystems depended on their complexity. To take an extreme example, farmlands dominated by a single crop are so unstable that one year of bad weather or the invasion of a single pest can destroy the entire crop. In contrast, a complex climax community, such as a temperate forest, will tolerate considerable damage from weather to pests.</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">The question of ecosystem stability is complicated, however. The first problem is that ecologists do not all agree what “stability” means. Stability can be defined as simply lack of change. In that case, the climax community would be considered the most stable, since, by definition, it changes the least over time. Alternatively, stability can be defined as the speed with which an ecosystem returns to a particular form following a major disturbance, such as a fire. This kind of stability is also called resilience. In that case, climax communities would be the most fragile and the least stable, since they can require hundreds of years to return to the climax state.</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Even the kind of stability defined as simple lack of change is not always associated with maximum diversity. At least in temperate zones, maximum diversity is often found in mid-successional stages, not in the climax community. Once a redwood forest matures, for example, the kinds of species and the number of individuals growing on the forest floor are reduced. In general, diversity, by itself, does not ensure stability. Mathematical models of ecosystems likewise suggest that diversity does not guarantee ecosystem stability—just the opposite, in fact. A more complicated system is, in general, more likely than a simple system to break down. A fifteen-speed racing bicycle is more likely to break down than a child’s tricycle.</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Ecologists are especially interested to know what factors contribute to the resilience of communities because climax communities all over the world are being severely damaged or destroyed by human activities. The destruction caused by the volcanic explosion of Mount St. Helens, in the northwestern United States, for example, pales in comparison to the destruction caused by humans. We need to know what aspects of a community are most important to the community’s resistance to destruction, as well as its recovery.</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Many ecologists now think that the relative long-term stability of climax communities comes not from diversity but from the “patchiness” of the environment, an environment that varies from place to place supports more kinds of organisms than an environment that is uniform. A local population that goes extinct is quickly replaced by immigrants from an adjacent community. Even if the new population is of a different species, it can approximately fill the niche vacated by the extinct population and keep the food web intact.</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Paragraph 1: Plant communities assemble themselves flexibly, and their <span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5; background-color: rgb(216, 216, 216);">particular </span>structure depends on the specific history of the area.

Ecologists concluded that the apparent stability of climax ecosystems depended on their complexity. To take an extreme example, farmlands dominated by a single crop are so unstable that one year of bad weather or the invasion of a single pest can destroy the entire crop. In contrast, a complex climax community, such as a temperate forest, will tolerate considerable damage from weather to pests.</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">4. According to paragraph 3, ecologists once believed that which of the following illustrated the most stable ecosystems?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○Pioneer communities&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○Climax communities&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○Single-crop farmlands</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○Successional plant communities</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Paragraph 4: The question of ecosystem stability is complicated, however. The first problem is that ecologists do not all agree what “stability” means. Stability can be defined as simply lack of change. In that case, the climax community would be considered the most stable, since, by definition, it changes the least over time. Alternatively, stability can be defined as the speed with which an ecosystem returns to a particular form following a major disturbance, such as a fire. This kind of stability is also called resilience. In that case, climax communities would be the most fragile and the least stable, since they can require hundreds of years to return to the climax state.</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">5. According to paragraph 4, why is the question of ecosystem stability complicated?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○The reasons for ecosystem change are not always clear.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○Ecologists often confuse the word “stability” with the word “resilience.”</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○The exact meaning of the word “stability” is debated by ecologists.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○There are many different answers to ecological questions.</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">6. According to paragraph 4, which of the following is true of climax communities?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○They are more resilient than pioneer communities.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○They can be considered both the most and the least stable communities.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○They are stable because they recover quickly after major disturbances.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○They are the most resilient communities because they change the least over time.</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Paragraph 5: Even the kind of stability defined as simple lack of change is not always associated with maximum diversity. At least in temperate zones, maximum diversity is often found in mid-successional stages, not in the climax community. Once a redwood forest matures, for example, the kinds of species and the number of individuals growing on the forest floor are reduced. In general, diversity, by itself, does not ensure stability. Mathematical models of ecosystems likewise suggest that diversity does not guarantee ecosystem stability—just the opposite, in fact. A more complicated system is, in general, more likely than a simple system to break down. <span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5; background-color: rgb(216, 216, 216);">A fifteen-speed racing bicycle is more likely to break down than a child’s tricycle.</span></span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">7. Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 5 about redwood forests?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○They become less stable as they mature.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○They support many species when they reach climax.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○They are found in temperate zones.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○They have reduced diversity during mid-successional stages.</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">8.
