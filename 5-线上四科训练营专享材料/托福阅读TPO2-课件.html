They breathe through lungs, not through gills, and give birth to live young. Their streamlined bodies, the absence of hind legs, and the presence of a fluke1 and blowhole2 cannot disguise their affinities with land dwelling mammals. However, unlike the cases of sea otters and pinnipeds (seals, sea lions, and walruses, whose limbs are functional both on land and at sea), it is not easy to envision what the first whales looked like. Extinct but already fully marine cetaceans are known from the fossil record. How was the gap between a walking mammal and a swimming whale bridged? Missing until recently were fossils clearly intermediate, or transitional, between land mammals and cetaceans.</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Very exciting discoveries have finally allowed scientists to reconstruct the most likely origins of cetaceans. In 1979, a team looking for fossils in northern Pakistan found what proved to be the oldest fossil whale. The fossil was officially named Pakicetus in honor of the country where the discovery was made. Pakicetus was found embedded in rocks formed from river deposits that were 52 million years old. The river that formed these deposits was actually not far from an ancient ocean known as the Tethys Sea.</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">The fossil consists of a complete skull of an archaeocyte, an extinct group of ancestors of modern cetaceans. Although limited to a skull, the Pakicetus fossil provides precious details on the origins of cetaceans. The skull is cetacean-like but its jawbones lack the enlarged space that is filled with fat or oil and used for receiving underwater sound in modern whales. Pakicetus probably detected sound through the ear opening as in land mammals. The skull also lacks a blowhole, another cetacean adaptation for diving. Other features, however, show experts that Pakicetus is a transitional form between a group of extinct flesh-eating mammals, the mesonychids, and cetaceans. It has been suggested that Pakicetus fed on fish in shallow water and was not yet adapted for life in the open ocean. It probably bred and gave birth on land.</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Another major discovery was made in Egypt in 1989. Several skeletons of another early whale, Basilosaurus, were found in sediments left by the Tethys Sea and now exposed in the Sahara desert. This whale lived around 40 million years ago, 12 million years after Pakicetus. Many incomplete skeletons were found but they included, for the first time in an archaeocyte, a complete hind leg that features a foot with three tiny toes. Such legs would have been far too small to have supported the 50-foot-long Basilosaurus on land. Basilosaurus was undoubtedly a fully marine whale with possibly nonfunctional, or vestigial, hind legs.</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">An even more exciting find was reported in 1994, also from Pakistan. The now extinct whale Ambulocetus natans (&quot;the walking whale that swam&quot;) lived in the Tethys Sea 49 million years ago. It lived around 3 million years after Pakicetus but 9 million before Basilosaurus. The fossil luckily includes a good portion of the hind legs. The legs were strong and ended in long feet very much like those of a modern pinniped. The legs were certainly functional both on land and at sea. The whale retained a tail and lacked a fluke, the major means of locomotion in modern cetaceans. The structure of the backbone shows, however, that Ambulocetus swam like modern whales by moving the rear portion of its body up and down, even though a fluke was missing. The large hind legs were used for propulsion in water. On land, where it probably bred and gave birth, Ambulocetus may have moved around very much like a modern sea lion. It was undoubtedly a whale that linked life on land with life at sea</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">1.

The expansion of desert-like conditions into areas where they did not previously exist is called desertification. It has been estimated that an additional one-fourth of the Earth&#39;s land surface is threatened by this process.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Desertification is accomplished primarily through the loss of stabilizing natural vegetation and the subsequent accelerated erosion of the soil by wind and water. In some cases the loose soil is blown completely away, leaving a stony surface. In other cases, the finer particles may be removed, while the sand-sized particles are accumulated to form mobile hills or ridges of sand.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Even in the areas that retain a soil cover, the reduction of vegetation typically results in the loss of the soil&#39;s ability to absorb substantial quantities of water. The impact of raindrops on the loose soil tends to transfer fine clay particles into the tiniest soil spaces, sealing them and producing a surface that allows very little water penetration. Water absorption is greatly reduced; consequently runoff is increased, resulting in accelerated erosion rates. The gradual drying of the soil caused by its diminished ability to absorb water results in the further loss of vegetation, so that a cycle of progressive surface deterioration is established.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">In some regions, the increase in desert areas is occurring largely as the result of a trend toward drier climatic conditions. Continued gradual global warming has produced an increase in aridity for some areas over the past few thousand years. The process may be accelerated in subsequent decades if global warming resulting from air pollution seriously increases.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">There is little doubt, however, that desertification in most areas results primarily from human activities rather than natural processes. The semiarid lands bordering the deserts exist in a delicate ecological balance and are limited in their potential to adjust to increased environmental pressures. Expanding populations are subjecting the land to increasing pressures to provide them with food and fuel. In wet periods, the land may be able to respond to these stresses. During the dry periods that are common phenomena along the desert margins, though, the pressure on the land is often far in excess of its diminished capacity, and desertification results.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Four specific activities have been identified as major contributors to the desertification processes: overcultivation, overgrazing, firewood gathering, and overirrigation. The cultivation of crops has expanded into progressively drier regions as population densities have grown. These regions are especially likely to have periods of severe dryness, so that crop failures are common. Since the raising of most crops necessitates the prior removal of the natural vegetation, crop failures leave extensive tracts of land devoid of a plant cover and susceptible to wind and water erosion.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">The raising of livestock is a major economic activity in semiarid lands, where grasses are generally the dominant type of natural vegetation. The consequences of an excessive number of livestock grazing in an area are the reduction of the vegetation cover and the trampling and pulverization of the soil. This is usually followed by the drying of the soil and accelerated erosion.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Firewood is the chief fuel used for cooking and heating in many countries. The increased pressures of expanding populations have led to the removal of woody plants so that many cities and towns are surrounded by large areas completely lacking in trees and shrubs. The increasing use of dried animal waste as a substitute fuel has also hurt the soil because this valuable soil conditioner and source of plant nutrients is no longer being returned to the land.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">The final major human cause of desertification is soil salinization resulting from overirrigation. Excess water from irrigation sinks down into the water table. If no drainage system exists, the water table rises, bringing dissolved salts to the surface. The water evaporates and the salts are left behind, creating a white crustal layer that prevents air and water from reaching the underlying soil.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">The extreme seriousness of desertification results from the vast areas of land and the tremendous numbers of people affected, as well as from the great difficulty of reversing or even slowing the process. Once the soil has been removed by erosion, only the passage of centuries or millennia will enable new soil to form. In areas where considerable soil still remains, though, a rigorously enforced program of land protection and cover-crop planting may make it possible to reverse the present deterioration of the surface.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Paragraph 1: The deserts, which already occupy approximately a fourth of the Earth&#39;s land surface, have in recent decades been increasing at an alarming pace.

The impact of raindrops on the loose soil tends to transfer fine clay particles into the tiniest soil spaces, sealing them and producing a surface that allows very little water penetration. Water absorption is greatly reduced; consequently runoff is increased, resulting in accelerated erosion rates. The gradual drying of the soil caused by its diminished ability to absorb water results in the further loss of vegetation, so that a cycle of progressive surface deterioration is established.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">2.

Expanding populations are subjecting the land to increasing pressures to provide them with food and fuel. In wet periods, the land may be able to respond to these stresses. During the dry periods that are common phenomena along the desert margins, though, the pressure on the land is often far in excess of its diminished capacity, and desertification results.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">3.

These regions are especially likely to have periods of severe dryness, so that crop failures are common.

In the peepshow format, a film was viewed through a small opening in a machine that was created for that purpose. Thomas Edison&#39;s peepshow device, the Kinetoscope, was introduced to the public in 1894. It was designed for use in Kinetoscope parlors, or arcades, which contained only a few individual machines and permitted only one customer to view a short, 50-foot film at any one time. The first Kinetoscope parlors contained five machines. For the price of 25 cents (or 5 cents per machine), customers moved from machine to machine to watch five different films (or, in the case of famous prizefights, successive rounds of a single fight).</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">These Kinetoscope arcades were modeled on phonograph parlors, which had proven successful for Edison several years earlier. In the phonograph parlors, customers listened to recordings through individual ear tubes, moving from one machine to the next to hear different recorded speeches or pieces of music. The Kinetoscope parlors functioned in a similar way. Edison was more interested in the sale of Kinetoscopes (for roughly $1,000 apiece) to these parlors than in the films that would be run in them (which cost approximately $10 to $15 each). He refused to develop projection technology, reasoning that if he made and sold projectors, then exhibitors would purchase only one machine-a projector-from him instead of several.</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Exhibitors, however, wanted to maximize their profits, which they could do more readily by projecting a handful of films to hundreds of customers at a time (rather than one at a time) and by charging 25 to 50 cents admission. About a year after the opening of the first Kinetoscope parlor in 1894, showmen such as Louis and Auguste Lumiere, Thomas Armat and Charles Francis Jenkins, and Orville and Woodville Latham (with the assistance of Edison&#39;s former assistant, William Dickson) perfected projection devices. These early projection devices were used in vaudeville theaters, legitimate theaters, local town halls, makeshift storefront theaters, fairgrounds, and amusement parks to show films to a mass audience.</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">With the advent of projection in 1895-1896, motion pictures became the ultimate form of mass consumption. Previously, large audiences had viewed spectacles at the theater, where vaudeville, popular dramas, musical and minstrel shows, classical plays, lectures, and slide-and-lantern shows had been presented to several hundred spectators at a time. But the movies differed significantly from these other forms of entertainment, which depended on either live performance or (in the case of the slide-and-lantern shows) the active involvement of a master of ceremonies who assembled the final program.</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Although early exhibitors regularly accompanied movies with live acts, the substance of the movies themselves is mass-produced, prerecorded material that can easily be reproduced by theaters with little or no active participation by the exhibitor. Even though early exhibitors shaped their film programs by mixing films and other entertainments together in whichever way they thought would be most attractive to audiences or by accompanying them with lectures, their creative control remained limited. What audiences came to see was the technological marvel of the movies; the lifelike reproduction of the commonplace motion of trains, of waves striking the shore, and of people walking in the street; and the magic made possible by trick photography and the manipulation of the camera.</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">With the advent of projection, the viewer&#39;s relationship with the image was no longer private, as it had been with earlier peepshow devices such as the Kinetoscope and the Mutoscope, which was a similar machine that reproduced motion by means of successive images on individual photographic cards instead of on strips of celluloid. It suddenly became public—an experience that the viewer shared with dozens, scores, and even hundreds of others. At the same time, the image that the spectator looked at expanded from the minuscule peepshow dimensions of 1 or 2 inches (in height) to the life-size proportions of 6 or 9 feet.</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Paragraph 1: The cinema did not emerge as a form of mass consumption until its technology evolved from the initial &quot;peepshow&quot; format to the point where images were projected on a screen in a darkened theater.

According to paragraph 4, how did the early movies differ from previous spectacles that were presented to large audiences?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○They were a more expensive form of entertainment.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○They were viewed by larger audiences.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○They were more educational.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○They did not require live entertainers.</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;Paragraph 5: Although early exhibitors regularly accompanied movies with live acts, the substance of the movies themselves is mass-produced, prerecorded material that can easily be reproduced by theaters with little or no active participation by the exhibitor. Even though early exhibitors shaped their film programs by mixing films and other entertainments together in whichever way they thought would be most attractive to audiences or by accompanying them with lectures, their creative control remained limited. What audiences came to see was the technological marvel of the movies; the lifelike reproduction of the commonplace motion of trains, of waves striking the shore, and of people walking in the street; and the magic made possible by trick photography and the manipulation of the camera.</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">7. According to paragraph 5, what role did early exhibitors play in the presentation of movies in theaters?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○They decided how to combine various components of the film program.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○They advised film-makers on appropriate movie content.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○They often took part in the live-action performances.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○They produced and prerecorded the material that was shown in the theaters.</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">Paragraph 6: With the advent of projection, the viewer&#39;s relationship with the image was no longer private, as it had been with earlier peepshow devices such as the Kinetoscope and the Mutoscope, which was a similar machine that reproduced motion by means of successive images on individual photographic cards instead of on strips of celluloid. <span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5; background-color: rgb(216, 216, 216);">It </span>suddenly became public—an experience that the viewer shared with dozens, scores, and even hundreds of others. At the same time, the image that the spectator looked at <span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5; background-color: rgb(216, 216, 216);">expanded </span>from the minuscule peepshow dimensions of 1 or 2 inches (in height) to the life-size proportions of 6 or 9 feet.</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">8. Which of the following is mentioned in paragraph 6 as one of the ways the Mutoscope differed from the Kinetoscope?</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○Sound and motion were simultaneously produced in the Mutoscope.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○More than one person could view the images at the same time with the Mutoscope.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○The Mutoscope was a less sophisticated earlier prototype of the Kinetoscope.</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○A different type of material was used to produce the images used in the Mutoscope.</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">9. The word “It” in the passage refers to</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○The advent of projection</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○The viewer&#39;s relationship with the image</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○A similar machine</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○Celluloid</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">10. According to paragraph 6, the images seen by viewers in the earlier peepshows, compared to the images projected on the screen, were relatively</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○Small in size</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○Inexpensive to create</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○Unfocused&nbsp;</span></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">○Limited in subject matter</span></p><p><br/></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 1.5;">11.
